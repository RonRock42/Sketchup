      <p class="paragraph paragraph-4"><span class="highlight">Flexbox</span> is a CSS3 module for managing the distribution of space, and the positioning of elements, across the wide variety of screen sizes.</p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-2">Many layout designs that were difficult or impractical to create with CSS ‘sans-flexbox’, are are now easy to achieve. Vertically aligning or evenly spacing out elements are good examples.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">And for responsive designs, the possibilities are even cooler. Changing the ordering of elements for smaller (or larger) screens, for example, is simply a matter of changing the values, e.g. from <span class="code">&nbsp;1 </span>&nbsp;to <span class="code">&nbsp;4 </span>, for the new <span class="control">order</span> property! In short, flexbox allows us to easily manipulate the layout of an entire series of elements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="coffee-span-5 coffee-768-span-9 coffee-768-offset-3 coffee-460-span-12 coffee-460-offset-0">
      <p class="paragraph">Flexbox is mostly appropriate for components, or subsets, of websites and web applications. Not necessarily for the overall grid or layout.</p>
      <h6 class="outstanding">For responsive designs, the flexbox possibilities are even cooler.</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">In this guide we will go over the flexbox syntax and look at the visual effects that can be created with them. Also included are several practical examples and showcases of layout configurations made with flexbox. Let’s dive into this box of layout freedom!</p>

      <p class="paragraph">We touched upon a couple of the possibilities flexbox has to offer in the introduction above. The relatively easy to understand syntax provides a tremendous amount of layout control. There are a number of online resources available that discuss the different flexbox properties and their values. However, there are very few practical demonstrations that <span class="bold">showcase real design examples</span>. And as we all know, making something for production can differ significantly from showing something in an isolated setting. When using the flexbox syntax in isolation, potential conflicts with other properties are left out of the picture. An example would be using flexbox centering, together with specific margin settings for elements — in that case flexbox might seem to not exactly work as expected.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="coffee-span-5 coffee-768-span-9 coffee-768-offset-3 coffee-460-span-12 coffee-460-offset-0">
      <p class="paragraph">So let's get warmed up for this cool (and finally widely supported CSS3 module), and kick-off with a real life design example.&nbsp;In the design below most of the layout configuration is handled by flexbox. The logo and navigation container are nicely spaced out in the header without using complicated floats, inline-blocks or endless margin tweaks. The same is true for the navigation links. With flexbox, it takes just a few clicks to make them display this way.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The action items (newsletter subscribe request) are placed exactly in the middle of the area below the header. Both horizontally and vertically, something that would impose a serious challenge without the help of flexbox.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">The cool thing is that if you're viewing this example in Responsive Site Designer, you can easily play with the flex property values and see how the elements behave. Go ahead, click on the picture above to select the flex parent container. Then, on the design pane, scroll down to the position section. The flex controls are located right below the display drop down.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">You’ll see that changing the flex-direction is pretty intuitive. Depending on the value, the elements are stacked as a column or displayed inline as a row. Changing the justify-content drop down influence the position of the elements in that column or row. Now don’t go too wild immediately! Using flexbox is way more fun with a slightly better understanding of the mechanics.</p>

Although it is a major improvement over IE 8, 9 &amp; 10 (for which <a title="" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support" class="p-link">Microsoft stopped support in January 2016</a>) and offers good overall Flexbox support, it does suffer from a few Flexbugs. One of them relates to the use in <span class="control">min-height</span>. In order for flex elements to position themeselves, they need to know about the dimensions of the parent. Whenever a minimum height is used, the flex elements seem to get confused and act as if no height has been set at all. Luckily there are workarounds.<br><br>In the example above we use double nesting, placing a container in a columns, to fix issues. The subscribe input field and button are then placed in a grid container to position them with <span class="code">&nbsp;flex </span>.

      <p class="paragraph">As mentioned in the introduction, the current best practice is to use flexbox for subsets of the layout, not for constructing a complex, grid-based full page layout. One of the main reasons is that for large pages and/or slow connections, <a title="" href="https://jakearchibald.com/2014/dont-use-flexbox-for-page-layout/" class="p-link">the layout can shift</a> around during page loading.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">It is also not clear from the <a title="" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/" class="p-link">official specification</a> if flexbox was indeed intended for that type of usage.&nbsp;In fact, considering that the <a title="" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/" class="p-link">CSS Grid Layout</a> workgroup includes several of the same Editors, it seems more likely that the flexbox layout module was designed to address specific layout problems within parts of the overall layout, rather than to create a layout module for page or grid construction.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">Don’t take me wrong, flexbox is one of the most versatile and intuitive layout systems. However, it performs best when set to a specific purpose like, for example, aligning a series of items within a container. It’s also great for changing the layout direction or even the visual order of elements over different screen widths.<br>

      <h6 class="outstanding">Flexbox is one of the most versatile and intuitive layout systems.</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">Time to set up the initial flex layout, following which we can get to work on some fun demos and use cases!<br>

      <p class="paragraph">A flex layout is created by setting the display property of a container element to flex. This can be any element that contains other elements, from a simple column or container, to a subgrid or list element. The container can be any type of HTML container, a simple <span class="control">&lt;div&gt;</span> or a more semantically labelled element such as a &nbsp;<span class="control">&lt;section&gt;</span>&nbsp;or <span class="control">&lt;nav&gt;</span>. When the flex display value is used, the parent container becomes a flex-container, and all immediate children become flex-items.</p>
      <h6 class="outstanding">Responsive design is a requirement and height changes are very common.</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">The main characteristic of the flex container is the ability to modify the order, position, alignment, width or height of its children. This allows the designer to use the available space in the best possible way.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="coffee-span-5 coffee-768-span-9 coffee-768-offset-3 coffee-460-span-12 coffee-460-offset-0">
      <p class="paragraph">As we saw in the example above, even symmetrical perfection can be achieved. True, before flexbox we were able to use margin or padding to vertically center elements within a section. Or at least approach it for a static layout. But keeping multiple elements aligned is a big endeavour, especially if they are not the exact same size.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In addition, we’re living in a multi-device world where responsive design is a requirement and height changes are very common — due to, for example, wrapping text. As soon as that happens we would be entering the trouble zone, chasing height using breakpoints without a real solution to the problem.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In short, cleverly positioning elements within a container is both more powerful and less complicated with flexbox. There are five properties for the flex-container that can be used to influence the way the flex-items are laid out.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">The <span class="control">flex-direction</span> property is used to define the direction the&nbsp;flex-items follow in the flex container.&nbsp;The initial function is to tell the flex-items to position as (horizontal) rows or (vertical) columns.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In addition they can be instructed to change their natural order and reverse their position from right-to-left or bottom-to-top.<br>

      <h6>flex-direction<br>
      </h6>
      <p class="paragraph">The design example below illustrates the directional behavior. I dropped three containers in the (single column) of a full-width row. The normal behavior of these block elements would be to stack vertically, but choosing <span class="control">display</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"> flex </span>&nbsp; for the column and setting the <span class="control">flex-direction</span> to <span class="code">&nbsp;row </span>&nbsp; places them nicely next to each other.</p>

      <h6>A real flexbox design case</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">The project design went really smooth up until now. And that’s exactly how it is for demos that explain how flexbox works in isolated settings using stable, single-size, placeholders. But we’re dealing with a real design case here. The design has to look good, we’re using real elements, combinations of elements, and the paragraphs have different text lengths. And that’s how we find how flexbox really works!</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Let’s look a bit deeper into the width settings for the container elements. Giving them a width of 100% and using the flexbox settings as explained above, gives each of them an equal amount of the available space. But if we change the width to <span class="code">&nbsp;auto </span>, the width of each container varies. Without content inside they are all small, only as wide as defined by a default minimum width setting. With the exact same content, they all get the exact same width.&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="coffee-span-5 coffee-768-span-9 coffee-768-offset-3 coffee-460-span-12 coffee-460-offset-0">
      <p class="paragraph">Things get interesting when different content like, for example, different paragraph lengths, is used in the same type of container.&nbsp;Using <span class="code">&nbsp;auto </span>&nbsp;values for the width and flex-basis (we’ll get back to this property later), the flex-item is <a title="" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/#flex-basis-property" class="p-link">automatically sized based on the its content</a>.&nbsp;In our example, the only difference is the text length of the three paragraphs. This causes the containers with more text to be wider than the containers with less text. <span class="highlight">Please note</span> that in order to demonstrate this the max-width had to be removed from the paragraph. That also means that <span class="highlight">if you’re reading this in IE, the bug I referenced above will pop up</span> causing the text to overlap.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Now, is this behaviour desirable? Looking at the example below, this can definitely be neat. However, with the different container sizes the images will resize differently at smaller widths. And although the containers maintain the same height when that happens, the horizontal alignment of the content is not maintained, a likely undesirable consequence for most design cases.&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="paragraph">The above already illustrates the powerful layout design possibilities flexbox offers. Independent of size container or element size, flex-items can be placed on a single line. This default behavior, always fitting <span class="emphasize">all</span> items onto one line can be influenced as well. That’s where the&nbsp;<span class="control">flex-wrap</span>&nbsp;property comes into play.</p>
      <h6>flex-wrap</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">The flex-wrap property can be used to position a series of items on a single, or on multiple lines. If there is not enough space available for the <span class="highlight">natural size</span> of the elements, setting this property to <span class="code">&nbsp;wrap </span>&nbsp;will place items that do not fit on the next line.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">The flex-container (column) below contains two blockquote elements. Yep, they are nicely vertically aligned, but that is something we will talk about related to other flex properties. The point here is that when using &nbsp;<span class="code">&nbsp;wrap </span>&nbsp;(with <span class="code">&nbsp;no-wrap </span>&nbsp;being the default) as value for the <span class="control">flex-wrap</span> property, these quotes will stack instead of shrink when there’s not enough room in the container to display them next to each other.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">If you’re following along within Responsive Site Designer this is easy to test: select one of quotes and on the design pane, increase the <span class="control">max-width</span> to <span class="code">&nbsp;600px </span>. With the row never being wider than 1200px this will make them stack.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">Using the width slider and decreasing the viewport width below to about 880px will have the same effect. If you’re reading this in a browser you can squish the windows to make them stack.</p>
      <h6>Natural sizes come in many forms</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">Both the width of an element and the available space are influenced by many parameters. Widths, heights, max-widths, paddings, and margins, they all play a role. As does the content itself.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">If the width is defined in pixels, all is clear. However, in a responsive design widths are mostly relative, often with a width defined beyond which the element should not grow anymore. One would expect the browser to use the max-width value as the&nbsp;‘maximum natural size’ and most of them do. This time it is Safari, or more precisely the WebKit rendering engine, that presents us with some unexpected behavior.&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="coffee-span-5 coffee-768-span-9 coffee-768-offset-3 coffee-460-span-12 coffee-460-offset-0">
      <p class="paragraph">Whenever a width has been defined for a flex-item, WebKit uses it for calculating the remaining available space, <span class="highlight">ignoring any maximum width</span> that may have been applied. An element with a 100% width and max-width of 400px will never be wider than the specified 400px pixel size. Still WebKit will take the 100%, inadvertently concluding that no space is available and stack the elements.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The work around? Not specifying a width! Using&nbsp;<span class="control">width:</span><span class="code"> auto </span>&nbsp;will do wonders. And if automatic resizing based on the content is not desirable, the max-width property can be used to restrain the content. Something that is needed on paragraphs to make IE behave anyway. Using the flex-basis property could be another option for preventing the resizing, we’ll look into that later. Now let’s see what options we have to distribute the flex-items over the horizontal or vertical space.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">This property can be used to distribute the flex-items over the space defined in the <span class="control">flex-direction</span>. If the flex-direction is set to <span class="code">&nbsp;row </span>, the <span class="control">justify-content</span> control determines how the elements are spaced out horizontally.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Similarly, when the flex-direction is used to create columns, this property&nbsp;determines how the elements are spaced out horizontally.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">The default value for the justify-content property is <span class="code">&nbsp;flex-start </span>.

      <p class="paragraph">Up to now we have been looking at the layout variations using property controls and values for the flex-container. An additional number of display possibilities can be created by defining flexbox rules for the (direct) children in the flex-container.</p>
      <h6>Reordering&nbsp;child-elements<br>
      </h6>
      <p class="paragraph">Initially the elements inside a flex-container are displayed in the order they were added. We already saw that this order can be reversed using the flex-direction property on the flex-container.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">The <span class="control">order</span> property available for the flex-items gives additional control over the order in which the elements are presented. Reusing the example with the horizontally centered items, we can switch the position of the third and second flex-item.<br>

    </div>
    <div class="coffee-span-5 coffee-768-span-9 coffee-768-offset-3 coffee-460-span-12 coffee-460-offset-0">
      <p class="paragraph">All we need for that is to assign order values. Using a value of <span class="code">&nbsp;1 </span>&nbsp; for the last flex-item and <span class="code">&nbsp;2 </span>&nbsp;for the middle item, will make them swap positions. All integer values are allowed here. Giving the third item a value of <span class="code">&nbsp;-1 </span>&nbsp;would make it the first placed element.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Since these items share the same clase, <span class="highlight">values for flexbox items should be assigned to a different selector</span>. A good rule of thumb is to use an additional class if the value is shared between a subset of the flex-items, and to add an ID if the value is specific to only one flex element. Order numbers are generally unique so I assigned them to separate IDs.&nbsp;</p>

      <h6>Real life content reordering</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">Product or service presentations are frequently laid out using a combination of text and images next to each other on wider screens. Then below the image-text order for the next product or feature is reversed.&nbsp;However, with less horizontal space available on small screens, many prefer to stack the items. <br>

Following that we discuss adjusting&nbsp;layouts for optimal viewing experience on any screen. It would be weird if the two text sections would follow each other on mobile devices; the separation of the two features would not be visually clear to the reader.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-1">To battle that we are "pushing and pulling" the columns. This can very well be done both manually and (using the drop downs) in RSD, but requires some conceptual layout thinking. Flexbox makes this <span class="emphasize">way</span> smoother and easier</p>

      <h6>Influencing element size with flexbox<br>
      </h6>
      <p class="paragraph">The ability to calculate and distribute space is one&nbsp;the greatest strengths of flexbox. The flex grow, shrink and basis properties can be used to influence how the available space in the parent (flex) container is allocated between the flex-items.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">The <span class="control">flex-basis</span> CSS property specifies the initial size of a flex item. The default value is <span class="code">&nbsp;auto </span>&nbsp;which instructs the browser to use the currently calculated width or height. In our examples where each of the flex-items (the white containers) used the same width (100%), the space gets distributed equally.&nbsp;<br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="coffee-span-5 coffee-768-span-9 coffee-768-offset-3 coffee-460-span-12 coffee-460-offset-0">
      <p class="paragraph">A specific initial size can be defined as well. The value can be set in pixels, ems or a percentage. (Please note that in RSD we currently only provide for percentages for this and several other size related controls. We do have a unit switcher on our roadmap for one of the upcoming versions though!)</p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-1">In the example below I gave each of the white containers an ID and assigned individual values for the flex-basis. The middle container is instructed to use <span class="code">&nbsp;40% </span>&nbsp;of the space, whereas the other two container each get <span class="code">&nbsp;15% </span>. This means that 30% of the space is left empty….but only as long as <span class="control">flex-grow</span> is set to <span class="code">&nbsp;0 </span>!</p>

      <p class="paragraph">It will be clear that the flex-grow (and shrink for that matter) will be less useful in the context of a fluid percentage based layout. I can see specific design cases where it could come in handy to have a certain item grow (and shrink) automatically from an initial situation where they are all sized equally. Right now this can be done by changing the values at a breakpoint, but it’s a little less automatic.</p>

      <h6>Maintaining horizontal alignment</h6>
      <p class="paragraph">We already learned that Flexbox can be used to create cards of the exact same height, even if the contents within the cards differ. Keeping&nbsp;action buttons or links horizontally aligned underneath a text section, has always been one of the other challenges when using flexible layouts.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Even with similar text lengths sentences of one section would wrap before the other sections. This then would push the items underneath down, before they would get pushed down in the other sections.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The example below shows three sections, or ‘cards’ as they are often called.&nbsp;The images are the same size, the headings are the same, as well as the paragraph styles. The only difference is the text length of each paragraph.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">It is a rather significant difference. Yet, the action buttons are perfectly aligned with each other. This happens because of two reasons. First, the cards (containers) with less content stretch as much is needed to have the same height as the container with the most content. Secondly, <span class="highlight">the paragraphs are instructed to take up any remaining available space</span> that is created because of the stretching.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="coffee-span-5 coffee-768-span-9 coffee-768-offset-3 coffee-460-span-12 coffee-460-offset-0">
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-1">Instructing an element to take up remaining space is done through the <span class="control">flex-grow</span> property. With a value of <span class="code">&nbsp;1 </span>&nbsp;— and an implied value of zero for the other elements — the paragraph is greedy and consumes all left-over space. With a background applied to the paragraph this would have been visible.</p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-1">If you are reading this guide in Responsive Site Designer, I invite you to apply that background to the paragraph and look at the effect. Another useful exercise would be to remove the <span class="code">&nbsp;flex-grow&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;class from the first (or last) paragraph. The flex-growth is tied to this selector and without it, the button will immediately move back up right under the text.</p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-1">The flex-grow (and its counterpart flex-shrink)&nbsp;property might take a little to get used, but they can be very powerful allies in a document where element and layout dimensions changed based upon available display width. As we touched upon earlier, a flex-grow value of 2 for an elements means it can take up twice as much of the remaining space as elements with a value of 1. Can you imagine the possibilities?</p>
